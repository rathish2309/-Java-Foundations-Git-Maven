Exercise Description:

Define an ArrayList of String and add any four names to it.
Using ListIterator, traverse through the ArrayList first in forward and then in the reverse direction, and print the names to the console.

Iterator - can move only forward and returns a Iterator<T>
ListIterator - can move both forward and backward (hasNext()-next() | hasPrevious()-previous()) and returns ListIterator<T>


Array List:
1) It is used for storing collection of objects
2) Used to Search operations - not suitable for add and delete because of continous memory allocation
3) Can store duplicate and null values
4) Insertion order is maintained
5) Store both Homogeneous and Heterogeneous objects

ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>(); -> Homegeneous
ArrayList arr = new ArrayList(); -> Heterogeneous
