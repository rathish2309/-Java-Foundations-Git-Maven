Exercise Description:

Define a LinkedList of String and add any four names to it.

Using 'for loop', traverse through the array and print the names to the console.

Remove the first and the last element and print the list using 'advanced for loop'.

Add new names at the first and last position and print the list using an iterator.

Linked List:
1) It is used for storing collection of objects as Array List
2) Used to Add | Delete operations - not suitable for search because of nodes are stored in different memory location
3) Can store duplicate and null values
4) Insertion order is maintained
5) Store both Homogeneous and Heterogeneous objects

LinkedList<Integer> arr = new LinkedList<>(); -> Homegeneous
LinkedList arr = new LinkedList(); -> Heterogeneous
